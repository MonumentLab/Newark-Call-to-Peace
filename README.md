# A Call to Peace proposals

The Monument Lab research team gathered 186 hand drawn monument proposals from residents and visitors to Newark in the fall of 2019 that responded to the question, “What is a timely monument for Newark?” In addition to asking for monument proposals, the paper form also included the following fields: "name your monument," "place your monument," "age," "zipcode," and "how do you identify?” as well as “your name, @, and/or hashtag”.  For each proposal collected, the research team transformed the form form into data in the following ways: 1) They assigned a unique identifier to the form, which they used to refer to that particular proposal across all data systems. 2) They scanned it to create a digital image, and named the image using the unique identifier. 3) They transcribed text fields from the form onto a table in Airtables and 4) They added each place identified on the hand drawn map to a separate table containing an inventory of all of the places identified by participants.

The resulting dataset is accessible in the following manner:
